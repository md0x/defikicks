Short description: 
On-chain governed and fully decentralized TVL and DeFi data aggregator

Description:
DefiKicks is where blockchain brilliance meets financial finesse. We're kickin' it up a notch, flipping the DeFi script with a fully decentralized, next-level approach to data aggregation. In our crypto cosmos, it's not just about presenting the latest and greatest in DeFi â€“ it's about doing it in a way that's transparent, trustworthy, and totally rad.

We've got smart contracts running the show, and our users are the real MVPs, calling the shots on how we calculate Total Value Locked (TVL) and all things DeFi. So, kick back, relax, and take control with DefiKicks. We're not just about riding the DeFi wave, we're about giving you the tools to make it your own. Welcome to the DeFi revolution, DefiKicks style. ðŸš€

DefiKicks aims to solve several key challenges that users often face in the DeFi (Decentralized Finance) space:

Data Transparency: DefiKicks offers a comprehensive and transparent view of the DeFi ecosystem. It aggregates and presents data from a multitude of DeFi protocols, providing users with up-to-date, reliable, and easy-to-understand information.

Cross-Chain Complexity: With the rise of various blockchains supporting DeFi, it can be challenging to keep track of protocols across different chains. DefiKicks solves this by providing cross-chain data, making it easier for users to compare and contrast DeFi protocols on various blockchains.

Decentralized Governance: Unlike many existing platforms, DefiKicks takes decentralization a step further. Through a set of smart contracts and decentralized backend tools, it allows the community to govern the project in a truly decentralized manner.

Ease of Use: Navigating the DeFi landscape can be daunting, especially for newcomers. DefiKicks simplifies this by offering an intuitive, user-friendly platform that helps users quickly understand and engage with the DeFi space.

Accessibility: DefiKicks is committed to making DeFi data accessible to everyone, free of charge. This promotes inclusivity and broadens participation in the DeFi sector.

In essence, DefiKicks is designed to be a comprehensive, user-friendly, and truly decentralized platform that promotes transparency and ease of use in the DeFi sector, making it easier for both new and experienced users to navigate the complex landscape of decentralized finance.

This is a beta kit to demo how to build a basic Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) on Filecoin. Currently, this kit contains these [OpenZeppelin contracts](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/governance): Timelock.sol, Governor.sol, and ERC20Votes. These contracts are used in conjuction with the [Filecoin Client Contract](https://github.com/filecoin-project/fvm-starter-kit-deal-making) to create a DAO that can vote on whether to propose a specific storage deal. This initial version is based on Patrick Collin's excellent repo and tutorial so be sure to check them out to learn more about how this DAO template works!

## Install

Open up your terminal (or command prompt) and navigate to a directory you would like to store this code on. Once there type in the following command:

```
yarn install
```


This will clone the data dao kit onto your computer, switch directories into the newly installed kit, and install the dependencies the kit needs to work.

## Get a Private Key

You can get a private key from a wallet provider [such as Metamask](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-export-an-account-s-private-key).


## Add your Private Key as an Environment Variable

Add your private key as an environment variable by running this command:

 ```
export PRIVATE_KEY='abcdef'
```

If you use a .env file, don't commit and push any changes to .env files that may contain sensitive information, such as a private key! If this information reaches a public GitHub repository, someone can use it to check if you have any Mainnet funds in that wallet address, and steal them!

## Fund the Deployer Address

Go to the [Hyperspace testnet faucet](https://hyperspace.yoga/#faucet), and paste in the Ethereum address from the previous step. This will send some hyperspace testnet FIL to the account.

## Deploy the Contracts

Currently there are 4 contracts in this repo:

* DAO Deal Client: This is the [Filecoin Client Contract](https://github.com/filecoin-project/fvm-starter-kit-deal-making) which can propose deals to storage miners. This contract uses the [OpenZeppelin Ownable.sol contract](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/access-control#ownership-and-ownable) to switch the owner of this DealClient to be TimeLock.sol on deployment.

* Data Governance Token: This contract mints [OpenZeppelin ERC20Votes](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc20#ERC20Votes) token which are used to vote on DAO proposals (or delegate another person to vote on your behalf).

* Governor Contract: This contract, based on the [OpenZeppelin Governor contract](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/governance#Governor), manages proposals and votes. This is the "heart" of the DAO.

* Time Lock: This contract, based on the [OpenZeppelin TimeLock contract](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/protect-your-users-with-smart-contract-timelocks/), creates a buffer between when proposals are passed and queued and when they can be executed. This allows gives users time to leave the DAO if a proposal that they don't agree with is passed.


Type in the following command in the terminal to deploy all contracts:

 ```
yarn hardhat deploy
```

This will compile all the contracts in the contracts folder and deploy them automatically! The deployments scripts can be found in the deploy folder. This should also generate a deployments directory which can referenced for the address and details of each deployment.

## Preparing Data for Storage

Before storing a file with a storage provider, it needs to be prepared by turning it into a .car file and the metadata must be recorded. To do this, the hardhat kit has a [tool submodule](https://github.com/filecoin-project/fevm-hardhat-kit/tree/main/tools), written in the language Go, which can do this for you. You can also use the [FVM Data Depot website](https://data.lighthouse.storage/) will automatically convert files to the .car format, output all the necessary metadata, and act as an HTTP retrieval point for the storage providers.

### How the Client Contract Works

The client contract is an example contract that uses the Filecoin.sol API's to create storage deals via Solidity smart contracts on Filecoin. This works by emitting a Solidity event that [Boost storage providers](https://boost.filecoin.io/) can listen to. To learn more about this contract feel free to [checkout the app kit repo](https://github.com/filecoin-project/fvm-starter-kit-deal-making) which includes a detailed readme and a frontend.
